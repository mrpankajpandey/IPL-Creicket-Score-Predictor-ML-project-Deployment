# IPL-Creicket-Score-Predictor-ML-project-Deployment
This Project Is All About Time Series Data 

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Given an IPL Dataset, can u predict the scores of the IPL team Currently Playing. The Dataset Has Following Cols:
* mid - match id
* date - when matches are played
* venue - place where matches aew played
* bat_team - batting team
* bowl_team - bowling team
* batsman - batsman
* bowler - bowler
* runs - runs scored
* wickets - wickets
* overs - overs - next 3 are based on this
* run_last_5 - runs scored in last 5 overs
* wicket_last_5 - wickets in last 5 overs
* stricker - batsman playing as main 1
* non-striker - batsman playing as runner up - not main 0
* total - total score (target variable)
